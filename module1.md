### Unit 1: The Problems with Agile at Scale

Unfortunately many organizations adopting agile methods end up with a paradigm we call "water-scrum-fall". In this popular pseudo-agile paradigm development teams work iteratively and incrementally, but it still takes months for work to get into the hands of development teams, and once work is "dev complete" it gets batched up into infrequent releases which must go through integration and testing. The overall lead time through this entire workflow is usually measured in many months, even years.

One of the problems with this paradigm is that it takes so long to get feedback. As a result, investment decisions are usually made through the "HiPPO method" (the "HIghly Paid Person's Opinion") rather than through economic modeling. Typically, much of the work that gets put into the investment decision is in the form of estimating costs. But as Douglas Hubbard, author of _How to Measure Anything_, [points out](https://www.cio.com/article/2438748/it-organization/the-it-measurement-inversion.html), "Even in projects with very uncertain development costs, we haven't found that those costs have a significant information value for the investment decision... The single most important unknown is whether the project will be canceled... The next most important variable is utilization of the system, including how quickly the system rolls out and whether some people will use it at all."

Another problem is that in this paradigm we batch up work into projects, which combine high-value work with low-value work and deliver it in large batches. In [research that was done](http://blackswanfarming.com/black-swan-farming-using-cost-of-delay/) at Maersk by Joshua J Arnold and Özlem Yüce, it was discovered that among the thousands of pieces of work sitting in the development backlog were three items which were each individually costing Maersk over $1m per week because they had not been delivered.

To summarize, the water-scrum-fall paradigm has the following critical problems:

* Focus on managing cost instead of creating value;
* Investment decisions are not made using economic models;
* Work is batched up into projects: no effective prioritization;
* Feedback loops are too slow: early decisions locked in;
* We waste the creative power of our people.
